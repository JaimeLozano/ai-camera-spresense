# ai-camera-spresense
This project uses a sony spresense board, a camera and artificial intelligence to control home devices.

## What is this project about
The device uses a camera and a trained neural network model to recognize when I seat next to the lamp and switches it on.
It recognizes patterns, can count number of people and can be trained for specific commands. Besides, this allows to save energy switching of when we are not present.

## How it works?
The Spresense Main Board uses the camera and a trained model to detect when the user is present. By strategically placing the Spresense on the room's corner, it can turn lights on and off as a user moves through the room. To do this, the Spresense is connected to a relay that acts as a switch. This allows the user to move around without touching the switches and  making a better use of energy.  This application requires the Spresense Main Board + Sprense Camera Board.
